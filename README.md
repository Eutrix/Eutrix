# Hi, I'm Toni! ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡·

**I no longer use GitHub.** I feel like it has become a monopoly for sharing code, and I don't want to support it any longer. 

I will keep this account active in case I want to participate in projects other people host here, but I won't host any of my new projects here.

### You can find all my new projects on **SourceHut**: https://git.sr.ht/~toni
